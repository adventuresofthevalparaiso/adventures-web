# Adventures of the Valparaiso
Component based Single Page website build with VueJS, packaged, optimized and deployed with Webpack and pre-rendered with PhantomJS.
#### Website Roadmap 2017
Because we're building components, there's an exponential growth in progress. The initial pages be built from scratch entirely while subsequent pages will consist of re-usable components.

*Currently the site is primarily built by a single developer outside of work hours, and a lot of things are still unclear or otherwise undecided, so this roadmap is limited and subject to change!*
> **April 25:**
> Initial boilerplating and setup.

> **May 8:**
> Start building homepage. Noteworthy components included on this page: header, navigation, next-up calendar item, footer, full-page video, gallery, social-media scraper.

> **June 19:**
> Completion homepage and its components. The homepage includes a lot of components that will be re-used throughout the website.

> **June 20:**
> Webdev meeting. With the homepage finished, we should take a moment to discuss how to proceed and set priorities. At this point we can also expand this roadmap.
